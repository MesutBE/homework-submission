## Types of Assignments

While studying with us you will come across 4 different types of assignments. They all serve different purposes, but all will help you succeed at HYF and beyond.

### Projects

> You are required to finish all projects

You will be assigned one project each week. The goal of projects is to get "the big picture". Learning how to approach a large challenge, break it down to smaller pieces, and apply the skills you're learning to build incremental solutions. These projects are about more than just writing code that works!  You'll be expected to ...
* Break your project into steps and to develop those steps on separate branches, merging them into `master` when the step is complete.
* Write a clean README describing what your project does, how it works, what you learned, and what you struggled with.
* Deploy your project using GitHub Pages at first, and non-static hosting solutions once you reach `Full-Stacking`.

Projects come in three types:
1. __Code-Alongs__: For code-along projects you will be assigned a video tutorial to study. You'll need to submit your version of the tutorial's project in a new repository developed with branches, and with a complete README.  Code-along projects are very good for learning new technologies and skills
1. __Starter-Code__: For starter-code projects you'll be given a repository containing a partially complete project and instructions about the steps necessary to complete it.  You'll need to submit your complete project in a new repository, developed with branches, and with a complete README.  Many of these projects will come with built-in tests to guide you on your way.  Starter-code projects will help you learn how to read and understand source code, debug existing projects, and work withing pre-existing constraints.
1. __Open-Ended__: Open-ended projects are what they sound like.  We'll give you a mock-up of a website or a list of user stories and the rest is up to you!  The code-alongs and starter-code projects are designed to guide you to good ways of structuring you code and solving common problems, open-ended projects are your chance to practice these skills "in the wild"!

### Exercises

> You are required to start all exercises

Alongside each week's project there will be a set of exercises.  Unlike projects the exercises will focus in on specific skills, tools or concepts.  Exercises are made up of smaller and more repetitive problems to solve, always with tests so you can move through them with confidence.

Sometimes there will be _a lot_ of exercises, and these exercises can be quite challenging.  You should start each set of exercises to be aware of the skills you're expected to apply in the projects, but you are not expected to complete every exercise the week they are assigned.  If you find you want to dive deeper into one topic, or that you've finished the project early and want to keep studying, go on and finish all the exercises!  Otherwise they'll always be there for you, you can go back and complete the exercises later in the course or after you leave HYF. This has been a successful strategy for many students before you.

### Assessments

> You are required to attend all assessments

Don't panic.  On a few Sunday mornings throughout your time with us there will be a small assessment.  These aren't like standard tests in school where we're measuring how well you can answer our questions so we can give you a grade.  And you won't get kicked out if you're having an off day.  We also take into consideration all of your projects, homeworks, and active participation.  If you don't do so well on an assessment it's not the end of the world.

Our assessments are what's called [formative assessments](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/what-are-formative-assessments-and-why-should-we-use-them/).  The goal of these assessments is to get an idea of where you each are in your learning.  What have you mastered? What do you still need to work on?  We'll use this information to make sure you each get the help you need, and to adjust the pace of the next module if necessary.

So get a little extra sleep the Saturday before, come in relaxed and rested, we'll hand out the assignment and you'll turn it in before class starts. These assessments will help us to help you, but aren't the only thing that counts.

### Suggested Study

> These are optional, but worth your time

Each module will have a file called `suggested-study.md`.  In here are a list of tutorials, projects, and extra study materials for you to explore.  Some of the suggested studies will help you prepare for the next module, others will go deeper into concepts covered in the module, and yet others are just fun and cool.  We won't be checking up on these, they're just here for you.

Enjoy!

### Submission and Feedback Process

We use GitHub [Issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) and  [Project Boards](https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-github-project-boards-2944e6ffbf3c) to submit assignments and give feedback.  The three biggest benefits to this are that your homework workflow will be very similar to a professional collaboration workflow, you'll be able to use GitHub's powerful code review tools to receive & implement feedback, and everything will be centralized in on place: your class repository on GitHub!


The weekly workflow for submission and feedback will look something like this:

1. Create a new issue in your class repo for each week's homework, then add each issue to the "TO DO" column of this module's project board.
1. Study away! You will keep your coaches and classmates up to date on your progress and your challenges by checking off the boxes in your issue and by moving your card on the project board.
1. If you are very stuck or confused, move your card to the "BLOCKED" column and leave a comment in your issue describing what has you blocked. Include [link(s) to specific line(s) of code](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet) in your repository!
1. When you think your homework is finished (the project is complete and you've started all of the exercises), move your card into the "READY FOR REVIEW" column.
1. A coach or alumni will look over your work
    * If there is anything to improve they will leave their feedback for you directly on GitHub, either in your weekly issue or as new issues in your repository
1. The coach/alumni will move your card into the "NEEDS REVISION" column
    * Read through the feedback and implement your changes.
    * When you think you've addressed all of the feedback, move your card back into the "READY FOR REVISION" column
1. The last two steps will repeat until a coach or alumni moves your card into the "DONE" column.  _(Only coaches and alumni can move cards into the "DONE" column!)_


The issues you make for tracking each week's homework should look something like this.  The cool bullet points `- [ ]` will turn into live check-boxes that generate nifty progress bars [like this](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-6/projects/1):

```
Name of Project:
* [repository](github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>),
* [github pages](https://<user-name>.github.io/<repo-name>) (if the project is static or has a report)

Project Steps:
- [ ]  [step 1](link to branch for step 1)
- [ ]  [step 2](link to branch for step 2)
- [ ]  [step 3](link to branch for step 3)
- [ ]  ... (you can check off the steps and add the links as you complete them)

Exercises
- [ ] [exercise name]()
- [ ] [exercise name]()
- [ ] ...

```
